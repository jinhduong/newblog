Hi guys, I'm **Dinh Duong**, I'm a full-stack engineer and working at Malaysia. I'm a crazy fan of football (especially is *Mesut Ã–zil* who play very smart but quite lazy), history and then is programming. 

<br>
 Now I'm currently interesting about `cloud` computing/ services, `containerization` philosophy with `Docker`, and then is `golang`.

 <br>
`Thanks` for reading my blog.
