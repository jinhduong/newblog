I'm Dĩnh, a software developer who likes ⚽ 🎮 ☕ 🍺 then finally is coding 💻 and I'm working at Malaysia. If not become a software developer I don't know what I am, so... I feel myself quite lucky. 😅. I like researching, writing, sharing and make miscellaneous. I'm currently interesting in `cloud computing/ services`, `golang`, `typescrtip` and improve my `algothrim`.

Thanks for reading my blog.
