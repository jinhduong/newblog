There are some my 🐕 pet/side/funny projects, which I wrote when have the freetime:

- [notifeee](https://nt.codfee.xyz/) - Notification service, free notification management for your site.
- [tikpog](https://tikpog.codfee.xyz/) - Send anonymous message
- [linq-fns](https://github.com/jinhduong/linq-fns) - `LINQ` implementation by `Typescript`
- [lazee](https://github.com/jinhduong/lazee) - The simple, lightweight, Google search like and pure javascript auto-complete 

... or my [github account](https://github.com/jinhduong) 😅.
